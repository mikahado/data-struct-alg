// SAMPLE CHALLENGES

// 1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K:
// - Given an array `arr` of integers and a window size `K`, you need to find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `K` within `arr`.
// - The "WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN" could be checking if the length of the current window is greater than `K`. If true, increment `left` and remove `arr[left]` from `curr`.
// - The `curr` variable can be updated by adding `arr[right]` to it.
// - The `ans` variable can be updated by taking the maximum of `ans` and `curr` at each iteration.

// 2. Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters:
// - Given a string `arr` and an integer `K`, you need to find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `K` distinct characters.
// - The "WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN" could be checking if the number of distinct characters in the current window is greater than `K`. If true, increment `left` and remove `arr[left]` from `curr`.
// - The `curr` variable can be updated by adding `arr[right]` to it.
// - The `ans` variable can be updated by taking the maximum of `ans` and the length of the current window at each iteration.

// 3. Smallest Subarray with a given sum:
// - Given an array `arr` of positive integers and a target sum `K`, you need to find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `K`.
// - The "WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN" could be checking if the sum of the current window is less than `K`. If true, increment `left` and remove `arr[left]` from `curr`.
// - The `curr` variable can be updated by adding `arr[right]` to it.
// - The `ans` variable can be updated by taking the minimum of `ans` and the length of the current window at each iteration.

// 4. Count of Subarrays with a given sum:
// - Given an array `arr` of integers and a target sum `K`, you need to find the count of subarrays that sum up to `K`.
// - The "WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN" could be checking if the sum of the current window is greater than `K`. If true, increment `left` and remove `arr[left]` from `curr`.
// - The `curr` variable can be updated by adding `arr[right]` to it.
// - The `ans` variable can be updated by adding the count of subarrays that sum up to `K` in each iteration.

// These challenges utilize the sliding window technique to solve different problems efficiently. Adapt the logic within the code snippet to match the requirements of each challenge.





// The algorithm blueprint represents the sliding window technique, a common approach for solving problems that involve maintaining a dynamic window or subarray within a larger array. The sliding window technique is efficient for solving problems that require finding subarrays or substrings with specific properties or constraints.

// The blueprint can be summarized as follows:

// Initialize three variables: left, ans, and curr. left represents the left pointer of the sliding window, ans stores the result or output of the problem, and curr maintains the current state or sum within the window.

// Use a for loop to iterate over the array arr using a right pointer, starting from index 0 and ending at the last index.

// Inside the loop, perform the necessary logic or operations to update curr based on the value at arr[right]. This logic could involve adding arr[right] to curr or performing some other computation.

// After updating curr, use a while loop with a condition that checks if the window condition is broken. This condition depends on the specific problem and can vary. It determines whether the window needs to shrink from the left side. Inside the while loop, remove arr[left] from curr and increment left to shrink the window.

// Update ans if necessary based on the current state of the window or curr. The update operation could involve comparing ans with curr and taking the maximum or minimum value, depending on the problem.

// After the for loop ends, return the final value of ans.

// The sliding window technique is useful for solving various problems efficiently, such as finding the maximum/minimum sum subarray, longest substring with certain properties, finding subarrays with a given sum, and more. It allows us to avoid redundant computations by dynamically adjusting the window and updating the result as we traverse the array.

// By adapting the "do logic here to add arr[right] to curr" and "WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN" parts of the code, you can utilize the sliding window technique to solve different types of problems that involve maintaining a window or subarray within an array.
