// SAMPLE CHALLENGES

// Merge two sorted arrays:
// Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2, you need to merge them into a single sorted array.
// The "CONDITION" could be checking if the element at arr1[i] is smaller than or equal to the element at arr2[j]. If true, increment i, otherwise increment j.
// The ans variable can be used to build the merged sorted array.

// Find the intersection of two sorted arrays:
// Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2, you need to find the common elements between them.
// The "CONDITION" could be checking if the element at arr1[i] is equal to the element at arr2[j]. If true, increment both i and j.
// The ans variable can be used to store the common elements found.

// Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings:
// Given an array of strings arr1, you need to find the longest common prefix among them.
// The "CONDITION" could be checking if the characters at arr1[i][j] are equal for all strings. If true, increment i and j.
// The ans variable can be used to store the longest common prefix found.

// Find the union of two arrays:
// Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, you need to find the union of all distinct elements.
// The "CONDITION" could be checking if the element at arr1[i] is less than or equal to the element at arr2[j]. If true, increment i, otherwise increment j.
// The ans variable can be used to store the union of distinct elements found.
// These challenges test various skills such as array manipulation, sorting, string operations, and more. Make sure to adapt the logic within the code snippet to match the requirements of each challenge.
